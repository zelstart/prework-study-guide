          <li>The <b>head</b> element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The <b>head</b> element is a container for metadata. meta elements contain information about the page that is used by the browser. The user won’t see information in the head or meta elements.</li>
          <li>The <b>body</b> element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li>The <b>title</b> element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO). </li>
          <li>The <b>style</b> element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The <b>base</b> element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The <b>link</b> element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document. A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element. </li>
            <li>The padding property is often confused withmargin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
            <li>* declares that all elements on the page will have the style properties</li>

          <ul>
            <li>In coding parlance, a variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
            <li>To declare a variable we use the var keyword. after the var keyword, we give the variable a name.</li>
            <li><b>Control Flow</b> is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
            <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, just in case you need it later. To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript code, put /* before and */ after the block of code</li>
            <br>
            <li>A <b>for</b> loop contains the following three important statements:</li>
          </ul>
          <ol>
            <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0): i.e   var x = 0;</li>
            <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. We use the length built-in array property on our shapes array to express that condition: i.e   x < shapes.length; </li>
            <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1: i.e   x++</li>
            <li>All together, the code looks like this: <br>
              for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) { <br>
                // code block<br>
              }</li><br>
          </ol>
          <ul>
            <li></li>
