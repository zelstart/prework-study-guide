# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

This webpage is a study guide for the prework for the UNH's Coding Bootcamp. It includes my notes on the things I felt I needed the most help to remember on the topics covered in the prework: HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. They're not extensive by any means, just the notes that I felt I would benefit most from having written down somewhere.

## Usage

There are notes on each topic covered in the prework on the webpage. You can look through them as needed. Alternatively, you could open up Chrome DevTools (Right click and "Inspect"; Command+Option+I for macOS; or Control+Shift+I for Windows) to get you to the console, and it will give a recommendation on what you could look at.
